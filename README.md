### Version 1.0.0 ###

#### [2023-07-05] ####
#### Currently, it is recommended to follow the guidance in PCmaster_anno_0_guide_1_mainly_in_Chinese.docx and install the environment from scratch. ####
#### Installing via requirements.txt seems to have compatibility issues at the moment. (It seems to be affected by conda version and network environment, too.) ####
#### Installing the compressed file PCmaster_anno_test_1.tar.gz via [this link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p1im8oCfebzGjzptk7PSmQ?pwd=nnvr) is the most convenient way, but there may also be compatibility issues. ####

#### It is recommended to put your ipynb, "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/PCmaster_anno_0_copy1.py" and "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/plant_marker_gene_list.txt" into the same folder. ####

#### If you don't want to reinstall the conda environment from scratch, you can download the compressed package through [this link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p1im8oCfebzGjzptk7PSmQ?pwd=nnvr), which also contains some files and codes that can be used for testing. ####
#### You can temporarily get some instructions through "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/PCmaster_anno_0_guide_1_mainly_in_Chinese.docx". We are trying to make a guide website. #### 
You can see some analysis examples in "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/PCmaster_anno_example_1.ipynb".    
If you want to use the latest version, please download the latest 'PCmaster_anno_0_XX_XX_XX.py' file and copy the code in it to replace the code in 'PCmaster_anno_0_copy1.py'.    
Please note that the latest version of the code may cause some undetected bugs.     

SCAPP is the old version of PCmaster_anno.
