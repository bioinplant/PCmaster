#### If you don't want to reinstall the conda environment from scratch, you can download the compressed package through [this link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qwpAcdd4NALRgTtTtMnnuw?pwd=wkwr), which also contains some files and codes that can be used for testing. ####
#### You can temporarily get some instructions through "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/PCmaster_anno_0_guide_1_mainly_in_Chinese.docx". We are trying to make a guide website. #### 
You can see some analysis examples in "PCmaster/PCmaster_anno/PCmaster_anno_example_1.ipynb".    
If you want to use the latest version, please download the latest 'PCmaster_anno_0_XX_XX_XX.py' file and copy the code in it to replace the code in 'PCmaster_anno_0_copy1.py'.    
Please note that the latest version of the code may cause some undetected bugs.
